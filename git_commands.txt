## initialize a repo
git init // initializes the directory to be monitored by git
git clone <url>  // clones a git repo to your working directory

## add and save changes to git
git remote add <name> <url>  // adds a remote repo to keep in synce with
git add  // add change to to staging area before being commited
git commit // opens your default text editor comments should be a command
git push <name> <branch>  // push your changes to the remote repo, name is the
    name you gave it when you used the command git remote add <name>
tip: each commit should equal one logical change
  example: two bugs in two different functions should get two commits one for each
tip: after making a change to a file use git add to add it to the staging area 
    when your ready to commit to the change type git commit and add a comment
    about your change

## view and compare changes
git log  // shows you the hitsory of the changes starting with most recent
git diff <ID> <ID> // lets you see the exact differences between the versions

## create and change branches
git branch // this command alone allows your to see what branches are available
git branch <name>  // creates a new branch called name so you can make changes 
     without affectin the master branch 
git checkout <ID>  // allows you to use a pervoius version/branch of a file 
git checkout master // returns back to the most recent code version
tip: after creating a branch use git checkout <branch name> to switch to it
tip: git checkout -b <branch>  // creates a new branch and swithces to it

## merging branches
git merge <branch> <branch>  // merges the branches
git fetch // fetches a remote branch but doesnt merge it with your master
tip: when merging branches the branch your on is always included
tip: When forking another repo and cloning to your local machine you should
  make changes on your master branch while keeping the original branch
  untouched. The original untouched branch is conventionally named upstream but
  you can name it whatever your want.
tip: when you make changes to a branch you should merge the upstream branch to
  yours to resolve confilcts, then you can push it to github and send a pull
  request to the owner.
